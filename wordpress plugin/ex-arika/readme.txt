* [Support Forum](http://wordpress.org/tags/bug-library)

== Installation ==

1. Download the plugin
1. Upload the extracted folder to the /wp-content/plugins/ directory
1. Activate the plugin in the Wordpress Admin
1. To get a basic Bug Library list showing on one of your Wordpress pages, create a new page and type the following text: [bug-library]

There are a number of optional arguments that can be specified with the shortcode. Here they are with examples for each:

[bug-library bugcategorylist='3,4,5'] = List of bug categories to display
[bug-library bugtypeid='4'] = List of bugs from a specific category
[bug-library bugstatusid='5'] = List of bugs that have a specific status
[bug-library bugpriorityid='6'] = List of bugs that have a specific priority

These shortcode options can be combined:

[bug-library bugcategorylist='3,4,5' bugtypeid='4' bugstatusid='5' bugpriorityid='6']

1. Configure the Bug Library General Options section for more control over the plugin functionality.
1. Copy the file single-bug-library-bugs.php from the bug-library plugin directory to your theme directory to display all information related to your bugs. You might have to edit this file a bit and compare it to single.php to get the proper layout to show up on your web site.
